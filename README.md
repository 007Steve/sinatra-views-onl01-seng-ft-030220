# Sinatra Views

## Outline

1. We can use Sinatra to render html instead of plain text. For clarity, we write our html in seperate files. 
2. By default, Sinatra uses a templating language called "erb," which we'll learn more about in the next lesson. 
3. By default, Sinatra will look for certain file names in a directory called `views`
4. Create different routes that each render a different view (each one with plain HTML)
